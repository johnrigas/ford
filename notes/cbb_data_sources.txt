raw data (start with espn scraping)
-espn
-cbssports

notes 
-constantly calculating win probabilities and therefore expected value based on odds
-win probabilities will need to include moneyline, spread, over/under, conference/tournament futures, correct score, weird props like 2 or more 3s, half bets, win margin bets, first score bets, race to bets 
    -moneyline, spread, over/under likely with highest expected value but will see, good to have all models
-figure out to automatically recognize and accept promos
-use microcontroller + fpga for display
-injury/suspension reports, etc
- +190 implies 100 / (100 + 190) = 100 / 290 = 34.48%

scraping schedule
-espn play by play constantly during games when in betting mode
